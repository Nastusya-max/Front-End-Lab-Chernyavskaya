# Asynchrony
* Develop 4 functions that can perform operations +, -, *, / but return result with some random delay (> than 1sec)
* Create stack calculation module that can interact with mentioned before functions and handle Reverse Polish notation input
* Calculate “1 2 + 3 × 4 +”
* Push code to repo “quirk numbers”

## Instructions
* For division use ":"
* Enter all numbers and signs of operations separated by a space. Example: '2 2 +'
* To display the result, the expression must contain calculation operations (+, -, *, :)
